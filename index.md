# Welcome to Bei Liu's personal website.
I am currently a postdoc at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a dedicated ***microscopist*** with a great passion on engineering ***biosensors*** and ***optogenetic*** tools. The purpose of this site is to provide useful information related to my research interests.

# Microscopy techniques
### single-molecule-imaging
- **Introduction:** No two molecules are alike. Single molecule imaging (SMI) also you to follow one molecule at a time, reserving the heterogenous information that may easily ignored by ensemble fluorescence measurement. Meanwhile, SM sensitivity allows researcher to study rare happend events. No over-expression is needed, thus maintaining the system under physilogical situation.
  
  SM techniques             | Suitable scenarios
  --------------------------| ------------------
  Single molecule tracking  | diffusivity, protein-protein interaction
  Single molecule FRET      | conformational change
  Single molecule bleaching | oligomerization states
  PALM/STORM                | superresolution

  Generally, SMI data processing is consit of four steps: 1) picking molecules from raw movie; 2) linking correspondent molecules on consecutive frames; 3) rendering tracking/reconstruction results; 4) post-analysis.
